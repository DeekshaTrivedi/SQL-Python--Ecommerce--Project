This project focuses on evaluating and benchmarking vendor performance using data-driven techniques. It analyzes key metrics such as delivery timeliness, cost efficiency, order fulfillment accuracy, and quality performance to identify trends, risks, and improvement opportunities. The analysis helps in optimizing supplier selection and enhancing overall supply chain efficiency.
Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization are used to transform raw vendor data into meaningful insights that support informed business decisions.
